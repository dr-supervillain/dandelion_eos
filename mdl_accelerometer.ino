//honestly you need to look into the "calibrated quat" code from the fastimu examples
//fastimu does most of the things we need, so in this module we'll work on developing the following functions
/*
-usersteps
-watch lifted 
-watch shook
-high g stop
-compass heading
-absolute orentation current //not possible without magnetometer-
-a primitive form of gesture sensing including left/right/up/down hand waves, and forward/back arm pull
-more gestures, arm swing and more. oh yeah baby we casting SPELLS with these gesture movements like a fuckin helldivers combo (lamfo)
